Realtime Data Streaming With TCP Socket, Apache Spark, OpenAI LLM, Kafka and Elasticsearch
# This project serves as a comprehensive guide to building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using TCP/IP Socket, Apache Spark, OpenAI LLM, Kafka and Elasticsearch. It covers each stage from data acquisition, processing, sentiment analysis with ChatGPT, production to kafka topic and connection to elasticsearch.


#Data Source: We use yelp.com dataset for our pipeline.
#TCP/IP Socket: Used to stream data over the network in chunks
#Apache Spark: For data processing with its master and worker nodes.
#Confluent Kafka: Our cluster on the cloud
#Control Center and Schema Registry: Helps in monitoring and schema management of our Kafka streams.
#Kafka Connect: For connecting to elasticsearch
#Elasticsearch: For indexing and querying
